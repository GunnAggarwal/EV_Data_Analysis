# Project Overview 

The primary objective of this project is to analyze EV charging data and develop machine learning models to optimize charging station efficiency. The key goals include:

Understanding Energy Consumption Patterns: Analyzing charging trends across different locations and time periods.

Predicting Connector Efficiency: Using machine learning models to estimate how efficiently different connectors utilize energy.

Optimizing Charging Infrastructure: Identifying peak usage times and suggesting improvements for better resource allocation.

# Dataset Overview 

The dataset consists of 32,711 records of EV charging sessions.
Key columns: Start & End Time, Total kWh, Site, Model, Connector Type
